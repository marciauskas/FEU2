        <h2>What WOOW makes diferrent?</h2>
        <p>
          $WOW is a crypto token built on the Binance Smart Chain. $WOW tokens has a built-in tax that is initiated with every transaction; this transactional tax is 11% and is broken down in the following way: 3.3% is redistributed back to all holders, 3.3% to the liquidity pool and 4.4% to the $WOW charity wallet. As the charity wallet grows, funds are extracted monthly for donations towards nature conservation activities and preservation of wildlife. The $WOW team will always be the most transparent developer team in the market with its investors.

        <h2>BNB Earnings</h2>
        <p>
          If you enjoy earning dividends from company shares, you will be blown away by the BNB earnings that $WOW offers. By holding just 50,000 $WOW tokens, you automatically enroll in the BNB earnings function. Compared to standard company share dividends, $WOW is categorized as high yield and pays out substantially more than your standard dividends. As the price of BNB increases so does the value of your holdings and your wallet. It’s simple, hold $WOW, earn BNB.

      <div class="linijinisBlokinis kvadratas">
        <h2>Staking</h2>
        <p>
          $WOW was designed for two major purposes; supporting as many charitable organizations in the world as possible while rewarding our holders with substantial returns for supporting. In addition to BNB earnings, you can also stake your $WOW for high interest returns. Buy, Stake and Hold while receiving some of the highest APY rates you’ve ever seen. Staking $WOW is compared to standard banking CD’s except this CD is built into the blockchain and produces upwards of 50% APY on average. Take your investment to another level while giving to charity at the same time. Even if you are not holding 50,000 $WOW tokens for BNB earnings and are not Staking, you will still earn $WOW tokens in rewards through our re-distribution feature in tokenomics.
